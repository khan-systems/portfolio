  "role": "Senior Frontend Developer",
  "duration": "10 weeks",
  "stack": ["React", "TypeScript", "Next.js", "Mapbox GL", "Elasticsearch"],
  "problem": "A real estate platform was losing users due to a clunky search experience. The legacy search took 8+ seconds to return results, map interactions were laggy, filtering was slow, and mobile performance was poor. Users were bouncing after the first search, and the conversion rate from search to inquiry was only 2.3%. The existing architecture couldn't handle the growing database of 2M+ property listings.",
  "solution": "Designed and implemented a modern property search UI using Next.js with server-side rendering for fast initial loads. Integrated Mapbox GL for smooth map interactions with clustered markers for performance. Implemented virtualized lists to handle thousands of search results efficiently. Used Elasticsearch for fast full-text search with faceted filtering. Added debounced search and optimistic UI updates for perceived performance. Implemented progressive image loading with blur-up technique.",
  "outcomes": [
    "Search response time reduced from 8.2s to 1.1s",
    "User engagement increased by 85% (time on search page)",
    "Bounce rate decreased by 40%",
    "Mobile Lighthouse score improved from 31 to 92",
    "Conversion rate increased from 2.3% to 5.7%"
