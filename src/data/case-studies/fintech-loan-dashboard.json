  "problem": "A financial services company needed a modern, performant dashboard to monitor thousands of loans in real-time. The existing system was slow, had poor UX for filtering and sorting, and couldn't handle large datasets efficiently. Load times exceeded 4 seconds, and the Lighthouse score was below 75.",
  "solution": "Built a high-performance React dashboard with virtualized table rendering, real-time KPI calculations, and interactive data visualizations. Implemented virtual scrolling to efficiently render 1,000+ rows, memoized expensive computations, and created custom SVG charts to avoid heavy charting library dependencies. Used TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for rapid, maintainable styling.",
